# you can tell im burnt out when i use these lol
### Why are you hosting most of the games on your own repls?
## I do this to make things such as bugfixing and modding more convinient.
### Why doesn't 1v1.lol work?
## Your school might be using a private network.
# Other things to note
### I won't be adding games from Coolmathgames (with the exception of Choppy Orc and other cherry picked games). Most people have it unblocked already. If its blocked for you just ask and i'll try to add the games you want.
### I can only add games that have a web-ready adaptation. No niche itch.io games for now. I will ***not*** add paid games under any conditions
### I will host a Minecraft/Eaglercraft server soon (not the one on my profile). I won't be providing clients. You can probably find one on youtube but i don't recommend or condone it.
